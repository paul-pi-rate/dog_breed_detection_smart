🐶 DOG BREED IDENTIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING
________________________________________
📌 Project Description
Dog Breed Identification is a deep learning-based image classification project where the system predicts the breed of a dog from an uploaded image.
This project uses:
•	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
•	Transfer Learning (VGG19)
•	TensorFlow & Keras
•	Flask Web Application
The trained model is saved as dogbreed.h5 and deployed using Flask for real-time prediction.

🏗 Technical Architecture

 
 

Architecture Flow:
1.	User uploads dog image
2.	Flask receives image
3.	Image preprocessing (Resize + Normalize)
4.	Image passed to VGG19 model
5.	Model predicts breed
6.	Result displayed on webpage

📊 Milestone 1: Dataset
The dataset contains images of various dog breeds such as:
•	Golden Retriever
•	Labrador
•	German Shepherd
•	Pug
•	Bulldog

 
Images are organized into folders based on breed names.

📈 Milestone 2: Data Preprocessing
Steps performed:
•	Resize images to 224x224
•	Normalize pixel values (1./255)
•	Data Augmentation
We used ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing.

🧠 Milestone 3: Model Building
We used Transfer Learning with VGG19.
Steps:
1.	Import VGG19 model
2.	Freeze base layers
3.	Add Dense layers
4.	Use Softmax activation
5.	Compile with Adam optimizer
6.	Train model
7.	Save model as dogbreed.h5

🌐 Milestone 4: Flask Application
We built a Flask web application that:
•	Loads trained model
•	Accepts uploaded image
•	Predicts dog breed
•	Displays result
